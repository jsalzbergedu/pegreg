# PEGREG
A lua library for compiling a subset of PEGs to FSTs.
Requires fst-fast-system (an NFST interpreter) and fst-fast (a lua library wrapping fst-fast-system).


# Roadmap
For arbitrary regular expressions or string literals A and B, this library
turns A/B, AB, and A* into DFAs quite well.
However, this library aims to make A/B and A* _possessive_, and allow
linear-time matching and capture.
Therefore, there are still two major items on the roadmap before this library can
be made a part of Rosie:

1. Possessiveness.
This will require queries that can find the following:
- [X] The DFA of an NFA
- [X] The states that ought to be demoted (their outgoing arrows ignored)
- [ ] The arrows that ought to be ignored
- [ ] The NFA resulting from removing those arrows

And interpreters (AST transformers) that can generate
- [X] NFAs from each subexpression of the AST
- [ ] DFAs from each sub-nfa
- [ ] B substates from each subexpression
- [ ] B states from each subexpression
- [ ] B subarrows from each subexpression
- [ ] B arrows from each subexpression
- [ ] The possessive NFA that results from removing the forbidden b arrows.

2. Matching subexpressions
This library intends to use Danny Dub√© and Marc Feely's method of extracting
matches from DFAs, described in these two papers:
[Efficiently building a parse tree from a regular expression](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~feeley/papers/DubeFeeleyACTAINFORMATICA00.pdf)
[Automatic construction of parse trees for lexemes](http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2006/14-dube.pdf)
And implemented in [SILex](https://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/5/silex/trunk/silex.scm)

to do this, we need

- [ ] A backend that can accept `push`, `snoc`, and `sel`, instead of DFSTs operating from chars to char
- [ ] A frontend that emits those instructions instead of DFSTs from char to char
